#summary A page describing the experimental version.

= ScriptNo - Experimental Version =

Shiny New Features:
  * Block Unwanted Cookies - block cookies from being set by domains in the unwanted content domain list (Default: Disabled)
  * User-Agent Spoof - spoof your browser and operating system (Default: Disabled)
  * Referrer Spoof - spoofs the referrer for all requested resources (options: Same Document, Same Domain) (Default: Same Domain)
  * Leverages WebRequest API for more reliable blocking and cookie-blocking/spoofing features (http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.webRequest.html)
    * Since the current blocking method (event.preventDefault()) runs in parallel with this API, if your Chrome version doesn't support this experimental API yet, ScriptNo will still block resources using the current blocking method
